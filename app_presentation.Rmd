## Introduction

This is the final project, with the title "Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch", of the course 
["Developing Data Products"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products)

The goal of this app is to study how the Ozone concentration varies according
to "Solar radiation", "Wind" and "Temperature"

We consider the data set ***airquality*** included in the package datasets of R

It contains the following varibles:
```{r}
names(airquality)
```
but we focus only on the first four of them


## Details of the Data

A look at the data:
```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
str(airquality)
```

## The app: a picture

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./app_screenshot.png')
```

## App description

The UI structure:

- by *selectInput* can select between the 3 predictors
- by *sliderInput* can select the value of the predictor
- by *checkboxInput* can select which model wants to show

The SERVER structure:

- 2 models have been implemented (linear and cubic model)
- by *brushedPoints* one have to select, using the mouse, the points which will be interpolated
- interpolating curves and values are calculated
- fraction of points included in the interpolation calculated
